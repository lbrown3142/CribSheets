Java Script

Hoisting - variables are accessed before they are declared

code is compiled in two paces
	first pass reads variables/declarations (not value)
	second time around exicutes code 
	
avoid hoisting



Scope
	
	var variableName -> local if in function
	variableName -> global	#does not work in scrict mode
	
try catch -> variables declared are only in this scope -> block scope 



Numbers -> floating point numbers are inaccurate -> off my small amounts 

user.toFixed to round floating point number 

if referencing and object javascrip will take the valueof property of that object as the value


booleans

	var object && value = value
	
	
types

	primative types have different memory allocated (not referenced)
	reference types (everything else) have pointers
