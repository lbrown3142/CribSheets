Hadoop Administrator 

traditionally data throughput (reading data) is slow compared disk capacity 

throught put of 1000 disks is 1000 times faster than a single big disk 



installing cloudera manager 

	chech java version 

		java -version
		
	check java path

		echo $JAVA_HOME
		
	check path 
		
		env | grep PATH

	check python version (query all rpm packages and search for python) 

			sudo rpm -qa | grep python-2.6
			
	check mysql is install and running
		
		chkconfig | grep mysqld
		
		sudo server mysql service
		
		
	create data bases - users shell scripts mysql-setup.sql

	log into sql and list databases

		mysql -u root
		show tables 
		
	remove test databases, anonymous users etc

	check repo

		cat /etc/yum.repos.do/cloudera-cm5.repo

	install clouder manager daemons

		sudo yum -y cloudera-magager-daemons > cloudera manager server 


	check config 

		sudo chkconfig cloudera-scm-server off
		
	create the required database 

		sudo /use/share/cmf/schema/scm_prepare_database.sh mysql cmserver cmserveruser password 
		
	curl ports 8000 8050 

	start server

		sudo service cloudera-scm-server start
		
	review start up options

		ps was | grep [c]loudera-scm-server 
		
		
		
		
HDFS - watch again (first two) 

	name node
		
		only even orchestrates the process - not a bottl neck - no reads etcs 
		fs name node - contains metadata 
	
	secondary name node
	
	
	
HDFS File write 

	if any time of the pipeline anytihng fails, it does it again, can copy data from nodes that were successful 
	
	
	
	
HDFS file reading
	
	call to name name - request info of a file
	name node will return block names, locatiosn and persmissions
	fs data input steam is created and and gets data from block
	it also check if data is correct again the block is got it from
	if it fails it copies again and logs a corrupt file 
	

Name node use of memory

	use 1g per million hdfs blocks
	stores metadata for each block 
	this is why fewer bigger blocks are prefer to many small ones 
		- requires much more ram 
		
	
HDFS security

	file permissions

		similar to unix
		stop accidents 
	
	authenications
		
		kerberis - enterprise builds
		LDAP - can be used be uses clear view passwords so not recommended 
		
	access controll
	
		roll based access controll - apache sentry
		
	data encriptuon
	
		os level, hdfs level and network level -check for technology name
