HDFS Capacity.


Report Manager - Gain Visability 
Create forecast given data from RM

HDFS Directory Structure should has been designed well in advanced - thats the deck we've been delt 
We're getting new capacity over the next couple of weeks - bring us down to around 60% to begin with
	Does this give us a window of oppertunity to start redefined HDFS structure?
		Given the new tempary 'wiggle room'
			We could define a new stucture (where needed) and move and consolidate existsing directories into this.
					Once we know the directories have been migrated we can safely delete them. 
					
					
Before we ingest more DA data? - new security thing



Two ways to merge hdfs files:

Pull the data to one node and then put it back into hdfs restructured using hdfs commands
or
Use spark (if files are not too large) - don't need to copy it to a node first (in memory)


	
Steps:
	
1. Gain visability by utilsing report manager
2. (With the visiability gained from RM) Identify potential the directories that could consolidation and/or structured
3. See how much disk capacity this could save
3. Get the go ahead to implement the directory consolidation and restructuring 
4. Do it
5. Check if step 4 worked
6. Delete old directories
