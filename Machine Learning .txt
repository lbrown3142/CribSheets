Machine Learning


Machine learning is a field within AI - the science of making machine inteligent 

Machine learning ofcses on automated knowledge acquisition
	- mainly through the design and implementation of algoriths
	- these algorithms require empirical data as imput 
	
Machine laerning alorithms learn from data and often produce a predictive model as their output 
	models can then be use to make predictions as new data arrives
	
	
	
	
Three machine learning techniques are (three C's):
	
	- collaborative filtering (recommendations)
	
		helps users find items of relevance
			
			amoung a potentially vast nuber of choices
			based on comparision of preferences between users
			preferences can be either explicit (stated) or implicit(observed)
		
		- domain agnostsic 
		- relationships between users and items and not items themselves
		- amazon uses collaborative filtering to find users with similar taste
	
	- clustering
	
			- clustering is unsupervised learning 
				- beings with no structure defined
				- analysis data and defined a structure 
			
			- used to discover structures in collectsion of data werer the structure was not previously defined
			- discover which clusters (grouping) naturally occur in data by examiining various properties of the input data
			- clustering is often used for exploratory analysis
				- divide huge amount of data into smaller groups
				- can then tune analysis for each group 
				
			
				
			examples:
			
				marketing segmentations 
					- group similar custers in order to target them effectively
					
				finding related new articles
					- google news 
				
				epidemiological studies 
					- indentifing root causes
					
				computer vision (groups of pixels that cohere into objects)
					- related pixel clustered to recognize faces or linscense plates
	
	- classification
	
		- supervised learning 
			- require training with data that has known labels
			- a classifier can then label new data based on what it learned in training
		- start with known answer (label) e.g. a species 
		- use a dataset to train the model 
		
		examples:
		
			spam filtering - train the model based on what you say is or isnt spam
			oncology - train the model using images of tumors 
			risk analysis - train using financial records of customers who do/don't default
				- system will eventually learn to identify risks 
				
	algorithms
	
		many algorithms - no best algorithm
		better to have more data - more accurate results 
		some algorithms are better for low amount of data some are better at high amounts
		low data algorithms are better are worse at high data volumes and vice versa
