What is an artifact repository?

	- the binary repository manager
	- the place where you can store all your artifacts
	- proxy for remote repositories
	- your dependancy maanger will work again it 
	
	
source vs binary

sources

	- text
	- diffable
	- version by content
	- stored by overide 
	
binaries

	- blob of 1 and 0
	- not diffable
	- versioned by name 
	- should never overide
	
you don't want artifact in git as it clogs it up and slows it down -> should store binaries/artifact in a file system instead 


Requirements

	- proxy other repositories
	- search by name, context and content
	- maange artifact lifecycle 
	- clean up snapshots
	- optimise storage size 
		- checksum storage 
			- checksum used as filename - binaries 
		- append adds new artifact
		- garbage collection deletes old artifacts 
		
	- enforece module security 
	- expose rest API 
	
	
dependancies are stored in artitory and can be used by developers
	- as well as the artifacts
