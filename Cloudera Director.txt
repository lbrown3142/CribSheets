	default configurating using application.properties or can pass parameters with command

server will need to be restarted after a change to application.properties

	e.g. sudo service cloudera-director-server restart/start/stop


Getting started.

	setting up AWS
	
		set up amazon virtual private cloud (VPC)
		
			configured for forward and reverse hostname resolution
		
			use vpc wizzard
			
		create a new security group
			
			click Security groups
			
			create a new one for the VPC 
			
			click on inbound rules tab at the bottom
			
			configure as specified  in cloudera documentation
		
		
		
		create an SSH key pair 
		
			click on EC2
			
			in network & security select key pairs
			
			create new key pair and move automatically downloaded pem to secure location
			

Creating an EC2 instance

	choose AMI

		click ec2 and launch instance
		
		select a community AMI
		
	choose instance type
	
		choose a size - large is recommended, I'm trying with micro (free)
		
	add storrage
	
		minimum of 8gb recommended
		
	Add tag instance
		
		used talend_poc
		
	configure security groups 
	
		note: it did not let me select the security group I created earlier
		I had to create a new one with only the SSH configured. I then added 
		the all traffic section after I craeted the instance as I had to link
		the security group as source which was not created until I made the EC2.
